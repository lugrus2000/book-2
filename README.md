wpveda book
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wpveda/book.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wpveda/book)

**Status:** Just started. Far away from "ready to use".

Why another book?
=================

We wanted a single book to guide a php/web developer to through their complete WordPress journey.

Initial idea is create a training guide to train new talent in quantity without loosing quality of work!

Goals
======

Based on current status, it's better to list goals of this book.

1. Focus on WordPress themes and plugins development only.
2. Must NOT contradict with [wordpress.org handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/)
3. Use latest tools and technologies.
4. Separate develop, document, testing, build and deployment clearly.
5. Have opinionated workflow. Discuss every aspect and agree on "one-way" of doing themes but once a way is accepted, it should be the only way recommended by book.
6. After book is ready to use, write some tools to review codes against books workflow.
